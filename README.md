  ## 🏬Description
The Real Fake Store is a mock-up eCommerce shop that features a not-so-diverse selection of clothes, accessories, and electronics. This minimalist, straightforward online store allows shoppers to create a secured account which - then grants access to the displayed Comments and corresponding information for each. The shopper can easily scroll through their options, scan over prices, view reviews, and read short descriptions on all items. If they see a Comment they like, a `Buy Now` button can be clicked which simulates an order being processed.
